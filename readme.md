A recursive JsonConverter for python objects:

Simple class to convert any object (including object with dict properties and other complex types as properties) to json,
without having to convert it to dicts all the time

Your class just have to extend the JsonConverter class. That's all. :)

The POC file is just a proof of concept, with different types of data being converted to json.
